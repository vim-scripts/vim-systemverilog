This script detects system verilog files, does indents, and syntax highlighting.


This is the \\\\\\\"bug fix\\\\\\\" version of \\\\\\\"verilog_systemverilog.vim\\\\\\\" vimscript #1586 created by Amit Sethi.

With this fixed version, the key \\\\\\\"%\\\\\\\" (matchit.vim) works for Verilog/SystemVerilog files, which doesn\\\\\\&#039t work for the original version.



New features and changes since branch

Added folding expression:
Currently folds functions, tasks

Added matchit words for matchit.vim
